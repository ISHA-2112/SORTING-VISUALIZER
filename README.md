# Sorting Visualizer

The sorting algorithms play a very important role in understanding the essential computing fundamentals.  

May it be memory allocation or the ordering of processes, sorting algorithms are used widely to improve the efficiency.  

The cognitive understanding achieved through visualization is far more better than the one achieved through reading. In order to elucidate better, we have developed a website to visually explain the working of different types of sorting algorithms.  

The number of elements used for sorting can be changed according to the user preference. 
Also the speed of the demonstration can be altered according to the user's comfort.
